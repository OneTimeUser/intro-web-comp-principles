There are two primary aspects to this course. The first is learning how to build websites and prepare the various elements that comprise them. The second is understanding concepts behind computers in general and the Web in particular.

For the common syllabus of all sections, see [this page]( https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-UA.0004-004/common-syllabus/).

## TextBook

[Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-web-design/9781491960196/)\
5th Edition\
Jennifer Robbins\
ISBN: 978-1-491-96020-2

You can access an electronic version of the book [via NYU Libraries](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph007035495). A physical copy is also available on reserve at Bobst.

## Assignments

All assignments—including attachments—should be submitted via [NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/). 

Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It’s fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask another person to do the work for you. For reference, here is the [Computer Science Department’s statement on academic integrity](http://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html).

It is important not to get behind in turning in assignments. If you do get behind, we still want you to do the assignment; it is better to turn in a late assignment than to skip it. However, late assignments are penalized as follows: 10% during the first week late, 20% during the second week late, and 30% during the third week after the due date. Homework will not be accepted past the third week after its assigned due date without prior permission. Likewise, no assignments will be accepted after the final exam.

**Using NYU Classes to Submit Assignments**
1. Log into [NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/) with your NYU NetID and password.
2. Click on the tab for the appropriate class (if there is more than one).
3. Click on Assignments in the navigation bar on the left.
4. Click on the link for the corresponding assignment in the main window.
5. Add whatever comments to the grader that you may need to under "Assignment Text."
6. If file attachments are required, compress them and use the following naming convention: lastname_firstname_assignmentnumber
7. To attach files, click the Choose File button under “Attachments” to find the file you wish to submit and select it. Add additional files as necessary. Make sure that the file appears as an attachment before you continue.
8. When you are ready to, click on the Submit button and wait for confirmation before closing the browser window.
9. Please note that once you have submitted an assignment you can only resubmit it twice, so make sure that what you are submitting is the final version of your assignment. See your instructor with any questions about resubmissions.
  

## i6 Account

In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a special computer account on a Unix Web server which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an [**"i6" account**](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6) and we will use it to host our websites. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on [this FAQ page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq). If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to [this page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword) for instructions on how to do so.


## Software

Macintosh computers with all of the necessary software installed are available to you in the [Student Technology Centers]( https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/locations-and-facilities/student-technology-centers.html). You do not need  your own computer nor do you need to purchase any software. However, you will be learning how to use various programs and may wish to have access to them at home or on your laptop. In this case, you must purchase a subscription or use a trial version, which is sometimes available from the publisher. You can download software provided by ITS to all students, including SFTP programs, by going to the [ITS software page](https://www.nyu.edu/its/software/).

You probably already know this but NYU has given remote access to Adobe Creative Cloud and other software!

## Tutoring

Tutors will be available throughout the semester both in person and remotely at the following times. Remote tutoring is available on a drop-in basis. In-person tutoring requires [sign-up through NYU Connect](https://nyu.starfishsolutions.com/starfish-ops/); here is a [guide for scheduling an in-person session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tKjWZKlH_nT2NGE0uqB5Hn7zq_BwIqIijGcKPO7UqAo/).
