# Week 11: Javascript

### Lecture

This week we learn about JavaScript Events and some preliminary ways we handle events. There are many events we can access through the browser to make our websites interactive through user inputs, actions, and more.

- what are the ways to add event handling to your project?
- some of the major event handler properties are: `onclick`, `onmouseenter`, `onfocus`, `onerror`, `onkeypress`, `onload`, `onscroll`, `onresize`, `onselect`, and `onsubmit`; but there are many many [more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers#event_handlers).
- event types for adding event listeners are pretty much the same (just remove the 'on' part of the event handler property above). Find the official listing [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing).
- CSS transitions property is a powerful way to add dynamic animation to your objects without the use of fancy JavaScript.
- note that `if` statements help you add some programming logic.
- (not required but FYI) `for` loops also allow you to iterate over lists of items.

*View project files to get a good idea of how to accomplish your tasks. Break them apart and read the comments as that should help unpack it for you!*
