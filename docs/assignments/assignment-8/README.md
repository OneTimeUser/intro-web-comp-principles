# Javascript: Assignment-8
### Due Apr 21

In this assignment you will use Javascript to add interactivity to your website.

### Instructions

Make revisions and improvements to the site as necessary—you know more about making websites now. Using JavaScript add a new layer of interactivity to your website. We have gone over ideas already of what you can do, so take the reins and run with it.

Your JavaScript should be externally applied in a .js document. Include at least two DOM queries to access elements on the page. To make your page feel more interactive, write at least two JavaScript functions that are called in response to DOM events. One of these functions should update page content—such as a change to text or images—and one of the functions should change a CSS property.

In addition to the behavior described above, use the JavaScript Date object to update some aspect of the page for every day of the week. For example, a different image could be displayed, a different style rule could be applied, or different text could appear. This should be done for each of the seven days of the week. To that end, you will need to write one or more decision structures with conditional statements such as if and else if.

### Publishing Your Website
Upload your website to the i6 Unix server in its own directory. Test your files again once they are “live” on the Web server to make sure they are accessible. Update your assignments directory to link to this page.

### Submitting Your Assignment
Submit the following via NYU Classes. More information on submitting files with NYU Classes is also available here.

- The URL to your website on i6
- A compressed archive containing all the files of your website
