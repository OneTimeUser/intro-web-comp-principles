# Final Project: Assignment-9
### Due May 12

In this assignment you will use synthesize all that you know and further improve your website, adding multimedia and a web form to round it out.

### Instructions

Make revisions and improvements to the site as necessary—you know more about making websites now. Using JavaScript, audio and video and forms, add a new layer of dynamic content and interactivity to your website. We have gone over ideas already of what you can do, so take the reins and run with it. Nothing too complicated.

For Javascript, here is what should be done in your code:

- there should be an external .js file that contains all javascript.

1. use Javascript to access elements (i.e. `querySelector`)
2. use Javascript to change element content (such as text or images)
3. use Javascript to change element style

For Audio and Video:

- use at your discretion. I understand that audio and video don't feel necessary in all of your projects, but try to incorporate one or both. Often times, portfolio sites may have video captured or screen recordings of certain works. If you are a musician or athlete, I am sure content exitsts. If you play games, embed a twitch video or screen cap your own.

For Forms:

- create a contact form that simply sends an email to you when someone wants to contact you. This can be as complex or simple as you want. For example:

1. Email capture for a Newsletter
2. Name and email capture for contact
3. Name and email and inquiry capture

### Publishing Your Website
Upload your website to the i6 Unix server in its own directory. Test your files again once they are “live” on the Web server to make sure they are accessible. Update your assignments directory to link to this page.
