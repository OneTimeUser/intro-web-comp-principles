# HTML: Assignment-2
### Due Feb 18

In this assignment, you will create a three-page website about something: yourself, a hobbie, whatever.


### Project Setup

Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “me” or "robot-soccer", or you get the idea. HTML and image files associated with your new website should be placed inside of this directory. The home page of your website should be named “index.html”. Other pages can be named as you like, as long as filenames are lowercase, with no spaces.

When your website is finished, you will upload the project directory, along with its contents, to your i6 account. Your new website will then be available at (if your folder containing all your files and images is called 'me'): i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/me/

### Your Website

Three HTML web pages—about you—form the heart of the current assignment. Any combination of your background, interests, or experiences will do! You are to write these pages using a plain text editor such as Atom or Brackets. The focus of this assignment is on describing web page content with HTML; refrain from styling (unless it's font stuff we went over) the pages until the next assignment, CSS.

**Here is a list of required elements you should include in these pages.**

- There should be paragraph (`<p>`) and heading (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) text on each page.
- The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs.
- Each page should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.
- You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, or GIF) on each page. (We’ve not covered image editing yet but feel free to use images from your digital camera or smartphone as well as images downloaded from the Web.)
- All img elements should include src, width or height, and alt attributes with appropriate values.
- You should include an HTML list somewhere on one of your pages; this can be an ordered, unordered, or description list.
- There should be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to `<main>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`
- Pay close attention to your HTML tags and be sure to test your pages locally using Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.

### Publishing Your Site

Upload your project directory, including the HTML and the image files, to the i6 Unix server with an FTP client such as Fetch (from ITS) or WinSCP. Your files should go in the same “public_html” directory that your assignments page is in. Test your pages again using Firefox, Safari, or Chrome once they are “live” on the Web server to make sure they are accessible.

Finally, create a link from the “HTML” line of your assignments directory to the home page of your new website. So, make sure the first assignment line, HTML, is an anchor element that links to the index.html file of you newly created project folder. So, a link path for a project folder titled 'me' would look like: `me/index.html` or even `me/`
