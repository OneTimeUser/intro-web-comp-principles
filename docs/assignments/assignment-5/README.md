# Vector Graphics: Assignment-5
### DUE: MARCH 22

### Logo or Icon

Using Illustrator, create a logo or icon(s) for your existing site! You will be embedding this image onto your page as code and NOT as an `<img>` element. Take a look at the video to see how this is done.

Next, make your SVG a link. A common linkage for icons or logos is to redirect home or even send an email.

Finally, style the image with CSS. Your CSS should be coded into the stylesheet of your assignments page and include hover link states. Your vector graphic should have a level of complexity that demonstrates thoughtful exploration of SVG capability.

### Saving Your Project

Save your original project file in Illustrator (ai) format. When you are finished, export a separate svg file of your project.

### Publishing Your Images

Code the image directly into the HTML of your web page. Use the `<svg>`element to display your vector graphic on the page. For accessibility, add a `<title>` element as the first child of your SVG element with a description of the image.

Publish the web page along with your image to the i6 server. Your project should be available at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/. Update the code of your assignments directory to link to the (same) page. So if you included the image in your recipes.html page, then the link would be something like `<li><a href="me/recipes.html">Vector Images</a></li>`

### Submitting Your Assignment

Submit the following via NYU Classes.

1. The URL to your new web page that displays the images on i6
2. A compressed archive containing your Illustrator project file and the separate SVG file
