# Layout: Assignment-7
### due April 7

In this assignment, you will incorporate `grid` and `flex` into your current project. Also, feel free to begin a new project.

Use the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox) for arranging items along one axis—such as menu bars, paragraphs of text, or images. Use the CSS Grid Layout Module for the overall page structure. You can feel free to use the same general layout for every page of the site but you don’t need to.

Each of the web pages should include images and/or text and there should be clear navigation between each of the pages.

Feel free to enhance the behavior of your page using media queries again.
