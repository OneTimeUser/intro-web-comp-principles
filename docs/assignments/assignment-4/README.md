# Raster Graphics: Assignment-4
### DUE: MARCH 17

### Image

Using Photoshop, create a picture that has been made using layers. The image should feature a subject placed in an unlikely, unique, or impossible location OR if you have some other idea of what you want to do that fits more in line with the content of your webpage, DO IT! There should be at least FIVE layers—including the subject—and one of these should be a text layer. Try to make the image as realistic as possible, given its imaginary nature. You might place yourself in the Arctic, climbing a national monument, walking on the moon, or standing beside a celebrity. You might place a cat inside a washing machine! Or a pencil inside a stomach?!?

Pay attention to the edges of objects, shadows, and lighting as well as to the proportions of your objects. Use a variety of tools to enhance your image—there are many available in Photoshop and you are encouraged to explore them. Have fun with this assignment and feel free to be imaginative! You might need to use masks for your image so make sure to go [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/masking-layers.html)to learn how to make them.

### Saving Your Project

Save your original project file, layers intact, in Photoshop (PSD) format. Then, when your work is complete, export a version of your project as an optimized file (try to keep size under 2MB). Adjust the compression settings as necessary.

### Publishing Your Images

If your image fits well with the website you have been building, fantastic. Go ahead and find a place for it somewhere in your webpage - maybe in the top, maybe on a separate page.

If you cannot see how to integrate an image like this for your website, then just create it separately with a basic HTML page for your project-use the img element to display it.

Either way, add CSS to give your image and area for the image some basic styles. At minimum, this should include rule sets for the <img> element.

Update the code of your assignments directory to link to where this image is in your website. So if you included the image in you recipes.html page, then the link would be something like `<li><a href="me/recipes.html">Raster Images</a></li>`

### Submitting Your Assignment

Submit the following via NYU Classes.

1. The URL to your new web page that displays the images on i6
2. A compressed archive containing your Photoshop project file, JPG, PNG, GIF

The upload may take time; wait for confirmation before closing the browser window
Please note that you are required to submit files along with the URL in order to receive credit for your work.
