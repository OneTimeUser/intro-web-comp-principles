# Week 3: HTML

### Lecture

We continue on with HTML! There's so much here! Take a breath and pace yourself. You will not use everything every time! The following lessons are broken into two parts as a continuation of last weeks lessons. Each lesson as a zip file of what was marked up in that video. It is essentially the same file added onto from the lesson before. Finish one before moving to the next.

- various important elements and what they do
- some elements require attributes to function, namely, `<a>` and `<img />`

#### Follow Up
In the previous videos, I admit that my directory was looking pretty filthy so I recorded a quick follow up to show you how I reorganized everything and rechecked my documents to fix links that would be broken.
