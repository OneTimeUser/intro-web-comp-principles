# Week 3: HTML

### Lecture

We continue on with HTML! There's so much here! Take a breath and pace yourself. You will not use everything everytime! The following lessons are broken into two parts as a continuation of last weeks lessons. Each lesson as a zip file of what was marked up in that video. It is essentially the same file added onto from the lesson before. Finish one before moving to the next.

#### HTML
We talked about the anchor element: `<anchor>`which are links!\
What are `<div>` and `<span>` elements?\
Newly minted HTML5 semantic elements to help us section out our webpage.
