# Week 1: Introduction and UNIX

### Lecture

In this first class, we briefly go over elements and principles of the Internet, since that will be the medium we work with throughout the semester:

- what the Internet is and what constitutes the Internet
- few descriptions of types of networks: centralized, decentralized and distributed and what the characteristics are of each
- Examples and descriptions of digital signals or the term digital in general
- some terms: open source, accessibility, net neutrality, dark web, bits, bytes
- various UNIX commands and particulary `chmod` number keys.

We also go over [UNIX](/unix) and some helpful commands to get you comfortable on the 'command line'.

Let me know if you have any issues downloading.\
*in the video I brain lapsed on `rmdir -r <foldername>` not removing a directory. Apologies, it's `rm -r <foldername>` that actually removes the folder even if it contains items.
