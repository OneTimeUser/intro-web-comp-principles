# Week 14: Design Process and Hosting/Domains

### Lecture

This weeks async lecture rounded out our journey with html elements. The `<form>` allows you to add input elements to your pages so that you can gather information and data from your users in the form of contacts, email captures, or other functions.

Accessibility is a design aspect of web design and development that places importance on structurally and semantically making your project as widely usable and appreciable as possible. Through correctly used html, css, and JavaScript, you are doing your part to make sure that everyone can experience your creations.
