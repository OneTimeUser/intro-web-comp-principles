# Week 12: Web Audio and Video, Git Version Control

### Lecture

This week we learn how to add audio and video elements to our page. We will also learn about some programs that will help us optimize (reduce file size with maximum quality) our audio and video files since they tend to be large. We also go over version control with git and github.

### Audacity QUICK START

1. Open up Audacity. A screen similar to the above will appear.
2. Make sure that you have a microphone installed. You can use the built-in microphone on your laptop if need be, but a USB powered external microphone will really help to make your audio come out crisp and clear.
3. Click on the record button (#1) and begin speaking. A waveform will begin to appear (#2) as your voice is detected by the microphone.
4.  Click on the stop button (#3) in order to stop the recording.
5.  Click the rewind button (#4) and play button (#5) to listen to your recording.
6. To trim your recording make sure that the selection tool is clicked (#6) then highlight the portion of the audio that you would like to cut. Click on Edit > Cut to extract the selected area.
7.  To record a second clip, click the record button (#2) â€“ a second waveform will appear beneath the first.
8.  To reposition a clip, click on the slider tool (#7) and slide the desired clip back and forth.
9.  Using the volume adjustment tool (#8) you can increase or decrease the volume of a specific clip.
10. Your can import other audio files (WAV, MP3) by clicking on Project > Import Audio. The audio file will appear as a new waveform. Here is a small collection of sound effect files to get you started.
11. You can also apply special effects to your audio clips. This can be accomplished by selecting a portion of a clip using the selection tool (#6) and then using the Effect menu.
12. When you are finished working on your clip you should save your project by clicking on File > Save.
14. You can export your project as an MP3 file by clicking on File > Save Other > Export as MP3. Note that Audacity does not come pre-loaded with MP3 export capabilities. You can add this feature into the system by installing the free LAME MP3 Conversion Library.

With your newly created MP3 file you can create a soundtrack to a video, remix a song, or even create your own podcast.

### Handbrake QUICK START

### FFMPEG QUICK START

 ffmpeg is an easy way to output different versions of your audio and video files...but does so much more. It's a command line utility, so you use terminal or other command line tool to run it. A simple command looks like this:

 `$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi`

 In the above, the `$` is just you, the user. If you opened up terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windwos) or Git Bash (Windows) then you will see that the `$` is usually followed by your user name or account name. Then, we follow with the `ffmpeg` command to tell our system that we are using the ffmpeg library.

 From here, there are thousands of combinations of commands you can use, but a simple conversion of a single file format into another format would entail using input and output functions. The `-i` in the above sample command means that the path-to-the-file that follows it is the input file. That is the file we want to copy and convert to another file format. Then we end with the output file name and file type we desire. So `output.avi` does not exist (or if it exists, we are overwriting it) and we are naming it and telling ffmpeg which file type we want for the copy/conversion.

 We can also change other things to optimize our file size or resize the file, etc. The documentation is [here](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html). It's a good idea to work out what you want ahead of time, then begin to piece your command together. Also, don't forget the [power of searching for your answer on the web](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/28803/how-can-i-reduce-a-videos-size-with-ffmpeg)!
