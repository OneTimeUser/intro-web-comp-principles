### Lecture

We continue on with CSS tackling the painful part of CSS, manual positioning.

#### Table Styles and Pseudo selectors

[Link to Tables and Pseudo Intro](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/play/vgSYZJIWOGv8uzotxXuPw_shpAUAZUBJ7utj3RLsOkptLPAHGB8QuHSc3llPtsIK389aD1NajnXntqcA.eXmz9MK5Zvm3OR84)\

I showed some simple table styling and pseudo selectors like `p:first-child` and `li:nth-child` which essentially offer greater granularity in selecting individual elements within their siblings. This is handy in lists or a matrix of images for example.

Check out this nth-child tester [HERE](css-tricks.com/examples/nth-child-tester) and check out a larger list of helpful structural pseudo-classes [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#tree-structural_pseudo-classes).
