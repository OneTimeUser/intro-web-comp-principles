# Week 5: CSS

### Lecture

We continue on with CSS tackling the painful part of CSS, manual positioning.

#### Table Styles and Pseudo selectors

[Link to Tables and Pseudo Intro](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/play/vgSYZJIWOGv8uzotxXuPw_shpAUAZUBJ7utj3RLsOkptLPAHGB8QuHSc3llPtsIK389aD1NajnXntqcA.eXmz9MK5Zvm3OR84)

I showed some simple table styling and pseudo selectors like `p:first-child` and `li:nth-child` which essentially offer greater granularity in selecting individual elements within their siblings. This is handy in lists or a matrix of images for example.

Check out this nth-child tester [HERE](css-tricks.com/examples/nth-child-tester) and check out a larger list of helpful structural pseudo-classes [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#tree-structural_pseudo-classes).

#### Layout

VIDEO COMING SOON

Take your time understanding this.

We started off talking about the `display` property. I've showed you some of this already and talked about the values `inline` and `block`. Other values to note: `inline-block` and `none`. `display: none;` should be differentiated from `visibility:hidden`.

Floating elements is also another method to position. You can float to the left or right of objects, and use the `clear` property to stop the floating.

Finally, we talk about `position` property which is used quite a lot, and each value has it's own special case, `relative` `absolute` `fixed` `sticky`.
