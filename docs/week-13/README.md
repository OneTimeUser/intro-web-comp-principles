# Week 13: Forms and Accessibility

### Lecture

This weeks async lecture rounded out our journey with html elements. The `<form>` allows you to add input elements to your pages so that you can gather information and data from your users in the form of contacts, email captures, or other functions.

Accessibility is a design aspect of web design and development that places importance on structurally and semantically making your project as widely usable and appreciable as possible. Through correctly used html, css, and JavaScript, you are doing your part to make sure that everyone can experience your creations.

The active form can be found [here](https://cims.nyu.edu/~aston/form.html). Please fill it out if you want.

As I said in class, Kwes.io is an easy service to tie up although, the success screen after a form is submitted is maybe not ideal. It does redirect after a moment but such is the life of a free user! The following are a couple other services you might want to consider, that still allow you to markup your forms the way you want, but have a forwarding service and/or processing built in. Mailthis also has a redirect success page after form submission though its more understated. Formspark has the ability to prevent page redirection, though you will have to handle success or error messages on your own. 

[Mailthis.to](mailthis.to)
[formspark](formspark.io)

Both are also very easy to do. Perhaps the most simplest implementation is Mailthis. After creating an email alias, your method attribute
