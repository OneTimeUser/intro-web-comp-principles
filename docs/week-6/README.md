# Week 6: Figma and Graphics

### Lecture

Figma!! Figma is an ideation and prototyping tool and is a good way for you to visualize an idea, a site, an app and more prior to coding it up! Additionally, there are other features embedded that allow you to take designs to code and production, but that is out of the scope of this class. Head over to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and create a free student account. 

As well, visit the [reaources page](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/) on how to get started and where to get help!

Graphics!! They add some punch to any website and are fun and fairly easy to work with. We have two types of graphics we are going to cover: raster graphics and vector graphics. Each has some specific types of images that are applicable.

- image types and their differences!
- which image style best suits a specific image types

Go ahead and get started by putting [Adobe Creative Cloud on your computer using NYU Services](https://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/KB0017797).

Here are also some Adobe provided tutorials for [Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html) and [Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html) if you want to engage in more advanced methods!

#### Raster Graphics

We talked about the various file types that comprise a raster graphic as well as some of the benefits, fallbacks, and use cases with using raster graphics.

#### Vector Graphics

We talked about svg and the `<svg>` element which houses our vector graphics for the web. What are the use cases for this file type?

To know more about how to unpack the svg element and understand it thoroughly, take a look [here](https://css-tricks.com/svg-path-syntax-illustrated-guide/).
