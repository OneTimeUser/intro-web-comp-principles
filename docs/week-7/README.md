# Week 7: Midterm


### Lecture

Midterm Review!!!!

No surprises, look back at previous weekly descriptions to understand what will be on the test. I have added in content that you should know.

If you are having general trouble in the class, please let me know or schedule a tutoring session NOW! Don't be afraid to speak up! I have time for you!

Just for fun and education, [here is a link to some Codepens](https://codepen.io/collection/DBgroK) I have gathered for the class that go over some topics but are mainly for creative/educational purposes. Some of the stuff we have yet to go over.
